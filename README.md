# 💻 C Programming Journey – Notes & Mini Projects 🚀

Welcome to my C programming vault! 🧠💡  
This repo contains everything from my first `printf()` to mini-projects like a **Banking System** and **Guessing Game**. Whether it's control flow, functions, or string manipulation — it's all here in one place, my **coding dojo**! 🥋

## 💎 Highlights

- 🎯 **Focused practice with real-life examples**
- 🧪 Experimentation with C concepts (variables, loops, functions)
- 🏗️ Terminal-based mini projects
- 🔐 Uses `stdbool.h`, `string.h`, `time.h`, `windows.h` (on Windows)
- 🎉 *All-in-one file for nostalgic code moments!* (See `notes_and_practice.c`)
